  caveats <<~EOS
    Set HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN to the shared read-only download token
    provided privately by the publisher. No repository invitation is needed.
    Stop all Bifrost sessions with 'bifrost down' before upgrading or uninstalling.
    The CLI runs in the foreground; 'up' prompts sudo for the root-owned helpers.
